# Dealing with the default tubes and bored to death?
Here we provide 4 extra types of tubes, give extra fun!

## Low Priority Tube Segment
This type of tube is the opposite of the High Priority Tube Segment, where items will choose to try to go to other tube segments before going into this one. This is useful in situations where it's hard to set up High Priority Tube Segments.

## Decelerating Pneumatic Tube Segment
This type of tube is the opposite of the Accelerating Pneumatic Tube Segment. While Accelerating Pneumatic Tube Segments would increase the speed of item by 1, Decelerating Pneumatic Tube Segments would decrease it by 0.5.

This is the only tube with a crafting recipe; place a dirt in the middle of the normal tube's recipe to get two.

## Eject Tube
This type of tube will eject items going by in the same direction they went into the tube. This is a neat alternative to dispensers that require mesecon power to eject items out.

## Reversing Tube Segment
This type of tube will reverse the way items go by. In other words, the tube sends the items back to where they came from.
